Give Me A Key
=============

Simple and strong password generator so you don't have to use the same password for multiple websites.


How to use this thing?
----------------------
Choose a master password and then use this script to generate sub-passwords for different sites.

	$ python givemeakey.py 
	Web: gmail.com
	User: jim.geovedi@gmail.com
	Master password: [HIDDEN]

Generated sub-password will be **copied to the Clipboard**. So easy, even your mother can use it!

Note: OSX only... ;-)
